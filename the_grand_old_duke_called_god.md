Here’s a poem about God — or perhaps, about obedience, power,  
and the curious way the sacred and the ridiculous sometimes share the same leash.  
A nursery rhyme, re-tuned for the digital congregation.

# 🏰 The Grand Old Duke Called God 🕊️
✨──────────────────────────────✨  

The Grand Old Duke of York 👑  
he had 10,000 men 👣.  
He marched them up to the top of the hill ⛰️,  
and he marched them down again ⬇️.  

And when they were up, they were up ☝️,  
and when they were down, they were down 👇.  
And when they were only halfway up ↕️,  
they were neither up or down 🤷.  

So here's some worship songs 🎶  
for the people in church ⛪ to sing.  
Shortened his name to **G-O-D** ✝️,  
because God's a lovely thing 💫.  

Now here's a little animal 🐶  
to control the population 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.  
I want this animal everywhere 🌍,  
all across the nation 🇬🇧.  

I want you buying it jumpers 🧶,  
and little buggies too 🛺.  
And here's some little red bins around 🟥  
when picking up its poo 💩.  

So the Grand Old Duke called God 🙏,  
he changed his name again 🔄,  
reversed the letters from back to front 🔁,  
but kept the sound the same 🔊.  

The reverse of God is **dog** 🐕.  
Now this is how you'll play 🎾.  
This is how you'll spend your time ⏰  
at the end of the working day 🌇.  

So the people did as told 🫡,  
over and over again 🔁.  
And if you wonder why that is 🤔,  
remember, his 10,000 men 🪖.
